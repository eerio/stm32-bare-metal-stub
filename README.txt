Hi,

This repo contains a basic project stub intended to give more
flexibility in terms of quickly creating new projects and stuff

It's got everything a GitHub project needs - a copy of GNU GPL v3
license, a README and some actual content. It's also got everything
I need to start writing the actual code - a proper Makefile,
a casual tree of folders, a script for programming and debugging
with GDB, some common problems faq, all the necessary headers etc.
